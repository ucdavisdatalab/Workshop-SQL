# Overview {-}

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language for interacting with
relational databases. This workshop covers basic SQL keywords to view, filter,
aggregate, and combine tables in a database. SQL is supported by many different
database systems. The examples in this workshop use a [SQLite][sqlite]
database, but most of the keywords are applicable to other database systems as
well. The workshop also covers how to use [SQLiteStudio][sqlitestudio], an
integrated development environment for SQL code.

Weâ€™ll focus on querying data to get to know a database and answer questions,
and joining data from separate tables.


#### Learning Objectives {-}

After this workshop learners should be able to:

* Describe the advantages and disadvantages of using SQL for data problems.
* Use SQL queries to view, filter, aggregate, and combine data.
* Combine SQL keywords to develop sophisticated queries.
* Use SQL queries to solve problems with and answer questions about data.
* Identify additional resources for learning more about SQL (such as how to use
  SQL with the R programming language).


#### Prerequisites {-}

No prior programming experience is necessary. Before the workshop, learners
should:

* Install [SQLiteStudio][sqlitestudio] and verify that it runs. See the
  [install guide][install] for details.
* Download the file `2022-04-04_intro-sql.zip` from [this link][materials].
  Unzip the file and keep track of where it's saved on your computer. It
  contains a data set and a script that will be used during the workshop:
    + `lcdb.db`
    + `intro_to_sql_spring22.sql`
