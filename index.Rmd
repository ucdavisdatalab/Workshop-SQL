# Overview {-}

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language for interacting with relational databases. This workshop covers basic SQL keywords to view, filter, aggregate, and combine tables in a database. SQL is supported by many different database management systems. Weâ€™ll focus on querying data to get to know a database and answer questions, and joining data from separate tables.

The examples in this workshop use a [SQLite][sqlite] database, but most of the keywords are applicable to other database systems as well. The workshop also covers how to use [SQLiteStudio][sqlitestudio], an integrated development environment for SQL code.


#### Learning Objectives {-}

After this workshop learners should be able to:

* Describe the advantages and disadvantages of using SQL with your own data.
* Use SQL queries to view, filter, aggregate, and combine data.
* Combine SQL keywords to develop sophisticated queries.
* Use SQL queries to solve problems with and answer questions about data.
* Identify additional resources for learning more about SQL, such as how to use
  SQL with the R programming language.


#### Prerequisites {-}

No prior programming experience is necessary. We recommend learners either attend or review the written materials for DataLab's[Overview of Databases & Data Storage Technologies](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_intro_to_databases/) workshop. 

Before the workshop, learners
should:

* Install [SQLiteStudio][sqlitestudio] and verify that it runs. See the
  [install guide][install] for details.
* Download the file `2024-04-09_library-data.sqlite` from [this link][materials].

Please see these [recommendations for making SQLiteStudio easier to read](https://veroniiiica.com/sqlitestudio-and-low-vision/), particularly for those with low vision and those who use a screen reader.

track, you can download the assessment [here][assessment].
