# Overview {-}

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language for interacting with relational databases. This workshop covers basic SQL keywords to view, filter, aggregate, and combine tables in a database. SQL is supported by many different database management systems. Weâ€™ll focus on querying data to get to know a database and answer questions, and joining data from separate tables.

The examples in this workshop use a SQLite database, but most of the keywords are applicable to other database systems as well. The workshop also covers how to use [SQLiteStudio][sqlitestudio], an integrated development environment for SQL code.


#### Learning Objectives {-}

After this workshop learners should be able to:

* Describe the advantages and disadvantages of using SQL with your own data.
* Use SQL queries to view, filter, aggregate, and combine data.
* Combine SQL keywords to develop sophisticated queries.
* Use SQL queries to solve problems with and answer questions about data.
* Identify additional resources for learning more about SQL, such as how to use
  SQL with the R programming language.


#### Prerequisites {-}

No prior programming experience is necessary. We recommend learners either attend or review the written materials for DataLab's [Overview of Databases & Data Storage Technologies](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_intro_to_databases/) workshop. 

Before the workshop, learners
should:

* Install SQLiteStudio using the [install guide][install] and verify that it runs.
* Download the file `2024-04-09_library-data.sqlite` from [this link][materials].

> **NOTE**:  
> If you have a Mac (OSX), you will need to right-click on the SQLiteStudio
> installer and select open. If you open the installer regularly, the Mac
> operating system will block the installer from running.


Please see these [recommendations for making SQLiteStudio easier to read](https://veroniiiica.com/sqlitestudio-and-low-vision/), particularly for those with low vision and those who use a screen reader.

## Data Disclosure and Appropriate Use {-}

The database in this lesson is based on a subset of data provisioned courtesy of the UC Davis Shields Library in 2024. All unique patron identifiers have been removed. Checkouts have been assigned a deidentified patron ID value. Use of these data is restricted to educational and operational purposes and is not intended for research. Patron groupings with fewer than 5 unique patron IDs have been lumped into broader categories to maintain privacy. If you have questions regarding the dataset and use, please contact us at [datalab-training@ucdavis.edu](mailto:datalab-training@ucdavis.edu) or the Library's Scholarly Communications Officer at [mladisch@ucdavis.edu](mailto:mladisch@ucdavis.edu).


#### Microcredential Assessment {-}
