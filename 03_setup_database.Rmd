To work with our database, we'll use [SQLiteStudio][]. It's a free, open
source, multi-platform desktop application for browsing SQLite databases and
writing SQL queries.

SQLiteStudio has a number of tools and panes to help you interact with your
data:

You can view databases in the pane outlined in green. You can also write and
run queries in the editor pane outlined in orange.

### Create a Database

We are going to work with a database that has already been created for us. To learn about how to create your own database from scratch using data stored in CSV files, see Geeks for Geeks' tutorial for how to [Import a CSV File Into an SQLite Table](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/import-a-csv-file-into-an-sqlite-table/)

### Load the Database



1. Click the "Add a database" icon ![](images/sqlitestudio-add-db-icon.png) [**3**] and the *Database Dialog Window* will pop up.
